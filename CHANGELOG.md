All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).


## 0.5 (released: 8/31/2022)

### Added
- [API AUTOMATION]
- localized api caching (do first for benchmarking)
- automated versioning for urlmapping
- automated batching
- api chainingÂ®
- separated I/O State for sharing/synchronizing of all endpoint rules
- built-in performance tracing (partial)
- [SECURITY]
- network groups
- role checking
- automated resolution for API3:2019 Excessive Data Exposure.


## 0.5.1 (released: 9/3/2022)

### Changed
- fixed issue with filter calling handlerinterceptor more than once
- removal of attributes before resetting when chaining


## 0.6.0-STABLE (released: 3/6/2023)

### Added
- reflection for controllers/handlers added so they no longer need to be added to I/O State files
  - corrected issue with reflection handler defaulting to alphabetically first handler if not found (bug in simpleUrlHandlerMapping)
  - stripped out staticMapping and using internal Controllers
- added CORS functionality
- updating mapping to automate CORS whitelisting per networkGrp; this allows for separate frontends for each 'backend' environment thus separating api environments by networkgrp on front/backend
- adding automated role-based apidocs; role based so user only sees docs they have access too (OWASP API COMPLIANT)
- added IO state reloading functionality
- lack of 'action' for mapping will default to 'apidocs/show' for only THAT controller; this makes it so if you dont know what you are calling, it provides fast/automated lookup
- apicalls with no 'action' will send back apidocs for endpoints for that controller that TOKEN has access to
- added receivesList/returnsList to ApiDescriptor
- added 'getApiDescriptor()' to IoStateService

### Changed
- simplifying mapping in config
- removing resource handling for file uploads except for supported mimetypes (JSON/XML); not a file server
- allowing api data to be sent as FILE; can simplify batching and complex calls to put JSON/XML all in FILE to send, detect and auto-parse into params (which we then check to see if they match expected request data for endpoint)
- performance improvements
- fixed issue with pkeys/fkeys not being stored in cache properly
- improvements to ApiDescriptor; better checking for request/response keys
- renamed nonmappedEndpoint to 'publicEndpoints'



 ## 0.6.5 - (released: 6/6/2023)
 
 ### Added
 - [AUTOMATION]
 - Added CLI service for reading in args in order to scaffold 
 - Added templates for scaffolded connectors
 - Scaffolding for connectors/IO State; allows users to scaffold connectors based on data from an existing entity/controller
 - (SDK) automated functional tests for ALL API's; moved to SDK
 - (SDK) automated webhooks (in progress)
 
 ### Changed
 - changing default 'iostateDir' to '.beapi/.iostate' for uniqueness
 - removed 'apiServer' from properties
 - adding 'protocol' to properties
 - updated tests in beapi-java-demo to use 'protocol' property; this way protocol can be set per env without changing tests
 - enable bootstrapping of multiple superusers/testusers through properties
 - simplify bootstrapping
 - added testRole to properties
 - updated 'user' domain; added columns for webhook monitoring
 - fixed RequestInitializationFilter to properly return errors
 
 ## 0.7.X - (projected release 08/01/2023)
 
 ### todo
    - add 'autoTest' toggle for automated tests from apiProperties/beapi_api.yml
    - need to make sure CLI does not overwrite existing files
    - (DOCS) need to add documentation for scaffolding functionality
    - (DOCS) add 'entityPackages' for beapi_api.yaml to documentation
    - (DOCS) apidocs documentation
    - (FRONTEND) UI/UX
    - (SDK) optional JMS service/config ??
    - (SDK) automated webhooks (need to do prior to rate limiting)
    - (SDK) rate limiting / data limiting (reliant on webhooks and DB)
    - (SDK) Read IOState files from CDN
    - (SDK) PropertySource for dataSourceProperties/apiProperties (in beapi-java-demo) needs to be dynamic via CDN

# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).


## 0.5 (released: 8/31/2022)

### Added
- [API AUTOMATION]
- localized api caching (do first for benchmarking)
- automated versioning for urlmapping
- automated batching
- api chainingÂ®
- separated I/O State for sharing/synchronizing of all endpoint rules
- built-in performance tracing (partial)
- [SECURITY]
- network groups
- role checking
- automated resolution for API3:2019 Excessive Data Exposure.


## 0.5.1 (released: 9/3/2022)

### Changed
- fixed issue with filter calling handlerinterceptor more than once
- removal of attributes before resetting when chaining


## 0.6.0-STABLE (released: 3/6/2023)

### Added
- reflection for controllers/handlers added so they no longer need to be added to I/O State files
  - corrected issue with reflection handler defaulting to alphabetically first handler if not found (bug in simpleUrlHandlerMapping)
  - stripped out staticMapping and using internal Controllers
- added CORS functionality
- updating mapping to automate CORS whitelisting per networkGrp; this allows for separate frontends for each 'backend' environment thus separating api environments by networkgrp on front/backend
- adding automated role-based apidocs; role based so user only sees docs they have access too (OWASP API COMPLIANT)
- added IO state reloading functionality
- lack of 'action' for mapping will default to 'apidocs/show' for only THAT controller; this makes it so if you dont know what you are calling, it provides fast/automated lookup
- apicalls with no 'action' will send back apidocs for endpoints for that controller that TOKEN has access to
- added receivesList/returnsList to ApiDescriptor
- added 'getApiDescriptor()' to IoStateService

### Changed
- simplifying mapping in config
- removing resource handling for file uploads except for supported mimetypes (JSON/XML); not a file server
- allowing api data to be sent as FILE; can simplify batching and complex calls to put JSON/XML all in FILE to send, detect and auto-parse into params (which we then check to see if they match expected request data for endpoint)
- performance improvements
- fixed issue with pkeys/fkeys not being stored in cache properly
- improvements to ApiDescriptor; better checking for request/response keys
- renamed nonmappedEndpoint to 'publicEndpoints'

### Additional
- releasing beginning SDK frontend with this release


 ## 0.6.5 - (released: 6/6/2023)
 
 ### Added
 - [AUTOMATION]
 - Added CLI service for reading in args in order to scaffold 
 - Added templates for scaffolded connectors
 - Scaffolding for connectors/IO State; allows users to scaffold connectors based on data from an existing entity/controller
 - additional tests for JPA/Hooks
 - (SDK) automated functional tests for ALL API's; moved to SDK
 - (SDK) automated webhooks (in progress)
 
 ### Changed
 - changing default 'iostateDir' to '.beapi/.iostate' for uniqueness
 - removed 'apiServer' from properties
 - adding 'protocol' to properties
 - updated tests in beapi-java-demo to use 'protocol' property; this way protocol can be set per env without changing tests
 - enable bootstrapping of multiple superusers/testusers through properties
 - simplify bootstrapping
 - added testRole to properties
 - updated 'user' domain; added columns for webhook monitoring
 - fixed RequestInitializationFilter to properly return errors
 - fixed CORS/JWT issue
 
 ## 0.7.0 - (released 07/21/2023)
 
 ### Added
 - PropertiesController and properties IOState for showing Application properties from config as API (not changing them though; that requires restart)
 - encoding for webhooks
 - tests for hooks
 - tests for properties
 - default properties being read from starter config
 - updating of Connector/IO-State on-the-fly added; allows changing all rules for apis without restart
 - added configurable server properties for tomcat server
 - integrating data components from demo project into starter to make it more of a API framework extending Springboot (as a starter should)
 - integrating security components from demo project into starter to make it more of a API framework extending Springboot (as a starter should)
 - added 'convention over config'; demo will be much simpler now going forward (as will docs)
 - added default for 'beapi_server' in case user forgets server properties; default server properties
 - added default for 'beapi_api' in case user forgets api properties; default api properties
 - connector scaffolding
 
 ### Changed
 - stability fixes
 - cleaned up/simplified user config
 - no longer need to added config to project; will read from .boot/{env}
 - moved DataSourceProperties config to starter
 - converted uriList/uList to UriObject for better usage/testing
 - moving core repositories/domains from demo project to starter
 - moving core security from demo project into starter
 - consolidated 'bootstrap' functionality into a service; only requires one line to bootstrap project from properties files

 ## 0.7.1 - (released 07/22/2023)

 ### Changed
 - stability fixes; cleanup


 ## 0.8.X - (projected release 11/01/2023)
 
 ### Added
 - tests for LinkRelations
 - automating HATEOS LinkRelations (if there are any) via passing of 'X-LINK-RELATIONS' header
 - added 'devnotes' (run with log level 'warn') which will let you know what went wrong and how to fix in the log
 - hooked up  beginning Trace service/functionality
 
 ### Changed
 - fixed issue with SimpleUrlMapping throwing error when 'action' not sent
 - adding back in webhook functionality
 - upgrading to Groovy 4.0.8 for tests
 - 'sealing' extended classes in call flow
 - speed/scale optimizations
 - removed functionality for bad uri to default to apidocs; can be exploited by DOS attacks.

 ### todo
    - (Feature) finish hook functionality (parially done)
    - (Feature) user management (also for frontend)
    - (Feature) rate limiting
    - (Feature) stats (check out Matamo for integration : https://developer.matomo.org/api-reference/tracking-api)
    - (Feature) CLI scaffolding of controller/domain/etc for new projects
    - (Feature) CLI init of new project; inits and creates project env based on package name 
    - (DOCS) separate DEMO docs from STARTER docs; keep in this project, easier to maintain
    - (DOCS) document LinkRelation functionality
    - (DOCS) documentation for scaffolding functionality
    - (DOCS) static endpoint documentation
    - (SDK) optional JMS service/config ??
